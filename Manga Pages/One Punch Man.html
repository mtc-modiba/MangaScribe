        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
        <p>One Punch Man is a superhero action manga that follows Saitama, an ordinary man who becomes so powerful that he can defeat any opponent with a single punch. </p>
        <p>Despite his overwhelming strength, Saitama is bored and frustrated by the lack of challenging opponents, leading him to join the Hero Association in hopes of finding a worthy adversary. </p>
        <p>As he faces various monsters and villains, Saitamaâ€™s struggle is not with his enemies, but with his own sense of purpose and the search for excitement in his otherwise mundane life. </p>
