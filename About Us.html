        <p>MangaScribe is a pioneering manga website launched in 2025, designed to cater to the rapidly growing demand for manga content in South Africa. The platform offers a wide variety of manga genres, from action-packed shonen to heartwarming shoujo and thought-provoking seinen.</p>

        <p>The idea for MangaScribe was conceived in early 2025 after recognizing the increasing popularity of manga worldwide as well as in the country, particularly among young adults and teens. I then took it upon myself to fill the gap in the market by creating a dedicated space for manga lovers in South Africa.</p>
